The progress of our project is: Completed.

Who did what:
  Nate- Coded the Start and MyPrintableTable classes.
          *Start is just the main method to start the GUI program.
          *MyPrintableTable is used to format what a printed file should look like.
                Nate spent most of his time on this, trying to understand it and implement it.
                
  Mohamed- Coded the Exceptions and SetNewClass classes.
          *Exceptions is the class that catches any exception and provides a related dialog box to the user
          *SetNewClass requires a lot of exception handling. It reads the contents of a folder for txt files
                to check if the user entered a name for a file that already exists.
                
  Jaspreet- Coded the LoadClass and MainMenu classes.
          *MainMenu is a screen with two buttons, prompting the user to load or create a class.
          *LoadClass allows the user to pick from a list of previously created classes. It reads from a folder 
                to find the previously created classes.
                
  Tannon- Coded the NewClass and LoadedClass classes. Also pieced the classes together.
          *NewClass takes the imput from SetNewClass to provide an editable table of values. Allows the user to 
                save the class to be loaded in LoadClass and print the table values to a physical printer.
          *Loaded class takes the selected class in LoadClass and presents the table with the same values as it 
                it was last saved as. Provides the option to save and print like NewClass.
          *Figured out how to pass parameters to each class to make the project run smoothly.
          
Everybody helped with bug fixing and beta testing.

What was difficult:
  *Creating, editing, and reading the contents of directories and txt files.
  *Figuring out how to create a normal looking format for print files.
  *Bug fixing. Catching as many errors in the code as possible.
  *Creating a workable GUI application withouot learning anything about GUI coding in class.
  *Figuring out how to print to an external printer.
  
  
What is already completed:  
  *All the code.
  
What needs to be done:
  *Comments
